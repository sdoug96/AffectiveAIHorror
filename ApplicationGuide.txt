This is a short guide explaining how the application works and how to play


How to play


The application contains 3 main sections each with a corridor section and side room. A key is hidden in each of these sections which will
be needed to unlock the next sction.


The player will start in corridor section 1 and their task is to locate the key to unlock the second section and so on.


A controller is needed to use the application as this is the only form of input that is accepted.


Once the player has found all three keys and unlocked the final door the application will end.


Application features


The main feature of this application is the affective AI that the user can choose whether or not to have running.


The affective AI contains a state machine system and a fuzzy logic system which are largely similar with the fuzzy logic offering a little
more in terms of gameplay changes.


Both systems will use facial recognition and the players heart rate to monitor the players fear and change the gameplay based on this.
